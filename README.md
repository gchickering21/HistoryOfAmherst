# Amherst-History

For this assignment, your group will be analyzing text from the book entitled *History of Amherst College during the First Half Century*.
The goal of the project is to identify some insights from the text. 
How you do this and what questions you explore is entirely up to you.  

This is the main work that you will be doing over the coming week (no HW, no Qwiklabs, no paper review).

The assignment should be pushed to GitHub by the end of the day on Sunday, October 4th (one submission per group).

## The book

See https://archive.org/details/historyofamherst00tyleiala for the book in a variety of formats

## Initial processing has been done for you

- I've spent some time preparing the book for your work.

- The `initial_processing` folder has the original text and the (admittedly clunky) code I used to create the chapter files.

- See the `chapterXX.txt` files in this folder. Each one corresponds to one of the chapters.
I imagine that these files will be most helpful to your work.
Note that they are rife with scanning errors and many words are broken at the end of lines.
You may find it helpful to fix some of these issues.

- The `toc.txt` may be helpful to orient you to the table of contents.

- The `index.txt` is unlikely to be of interest, but I included it for completeness.


## Ground rules

1. The assignment is very open-ended. Your goal is to extract some meaning from the report. How you do so is up to you.

2. The intended audience for the Executive Summary is Biddy Martin.

3. The intended audience for the remainder of the report is your classmates.

4. Please be sure that your code is fully reproducible and that code style standards are enforced.

5. The grading will involve a component of readability and reproducibility, use of the methods in chapter 19 of MDSR, and, and creativity.

6. You may include a Shiny app as a supplement to your report, but this is not required.

7. Your report should be pushed to this folder as `history_report.Rmd` and `history_report.pdf`.

8. Please do *not* talk with other groups about your or their work. I would like the groups to work independently.

9. As always, you may share specific technical questions with me on Slack. I ask that you be sure to cc your other group members on all such communication.

10. Have fun!
